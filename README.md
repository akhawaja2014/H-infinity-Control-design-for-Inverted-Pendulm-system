# H-infinity-Control-design-for-Inverted-Pendulm-system
An inverted pendulum is a pendulum in inverted position with its centre of gravity above its pivot point. It is inherently unstable and would fall down naturally without any external force. It needs consistent external force based
on feedback of its outputs, to keep it in upright position.

The inverted pendulum is fundamental problem in control theory, due to its immense theoretical significance, along with its numerous practical applications. The theoretical value
of the inverted pendulum comes from the fact that it is a nonlinear, under actuated
system, meaning that its equations of motion are nonlinear dierential
equations, making computation of an suitable control law a tedious task.
